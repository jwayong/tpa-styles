The `<tpa-styles>` component provides simple ways to use Material Design CSS styles
in your application with ING theming. The following imports are available:

1. [app-theme.html](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-styles/blob/master/app-theme.html): text,
background and accent colors that match the default ING theme based off Material Design

2. [typography.html](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-styles/blob/master/typography.html):
ING [font](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html#typography-styles) styles and sizes

3. [shared-styles.html](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-styles/blob/master/shared-styles.html):
TODO: Document this

We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `tpa-styles.html` as a whole.
